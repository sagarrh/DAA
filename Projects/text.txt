Affection is the feeling of acceptance for the other as one’s relative. Parents generally have a feeling of affection for their
children. The parents are very naturally able to relate to their children, feel concerned for them. Similarly, children feel
related to their parents. This feeling can also be seen between friends, siblings, between teacher and student, between
husband and wife, or any other relationship. It is a naturally acceptable feeling, and hence desired in every relationship.
The feeling of affection is essential for the fulfilment of any relationship. Particularly, for children, it is a necessity for their
development. The child feels secure in the early stages of development when it enjoys the affection of its parents. The
parents, though havthere in continuity only if it is based on the feelings of trust
and respect. If the first two feelings are not present in the Self, then the feeling of affection cannot be not continuous.
Lack of affection is seen in the form of opposition or jealousy. Such things too are observed in relationships. If the feeling
of affection is missing or lacking, then we feel opposed to the other and tend to have a feeling of jealousy. This can be
seen even in very young siblings. For example, if a brother is not able to accept his younger sister, then he would not have
a feeling of affection for her and he may keep vying for the parents’ full attention. The very feeling of trust is missing, so
respect is also violated. Like this, the boy is jealous of his sister and considers her to be his competitor.
